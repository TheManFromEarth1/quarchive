# Quarchive

*Traditional social bookmarking, with small improvements*

**Please beware that Quarchive is in an alpha state at the moment and has lots of bugs**

Quarchive is a open source social bookmarking system.

It consists of a web server and a browser extension (that syncs your bookmarks with the server).

## Building

To build the server you will need Python 3 and tox.  To build the browser
extension you will need npm.

Build both with:

```make```
