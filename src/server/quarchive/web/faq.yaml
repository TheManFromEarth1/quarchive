- question: When I add tags to my bookmarks in Firefox they aren't synced with Quarchive - why not?
  answer: |
    Sadly Firefox currently does not expose this data to extensions.  This
    problem is tracked as <a
    href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1225916">Firefox bug
    1225916</a>.

  slug: bookmark-local-tags

- question: Can other users see my bookmarks?
  answer: |
    No, your data is completely private.  Other users cannot see your
    bookmarks, your tags, your username, or anything else.

  slug: share-my-data

- question: Can I export my data?
  answer: |
    Not yet, but this is definitely planned.  Of course, all bookmark data
    except for tags also resides in your local browser.  (Tags are also present
    internally in the extension but are not user accessible.)

- question: Do I have to enter an email address when I register?
  answer: |
    No this is completely optional.  In the future it will be used to make
    password reset a self-serve process.
